  <h3>TRIBUTE TO A LOVED ONE</h3>
  <p class="firstletter"> Like a sapling we grew together, hoping and wishing for better days to come. We built our perfect life's in our imaginations and drafted the future in illusions, you were a source of <b>inspiration</b> and light to many people. <em>Words cannot really tell of how you loved and cared for others through your act of selflessness. </em> Throughout your journey on earth, you were a calm person, but in that calm nature of yours, you instilled joy and happiness to everyone who crossed your path. </p>
  <p> Dear Olofu, it's been a year since you walked this earth, I sometimes still imagine you on earth, but guess what, they are all imaginations. I won't get to see those beautiful smile of yours that gave people hope. Your death struck a <strong>blow,</strong> one that left many in pain and grief, although as the saying goes, <q>Time heals</q>, am still in the healing process and I believe all will be alright. The short life you lived here on earth was indeed a <i>remarkable </i> one, one which will not be forgotten in a haste. </p>

<div class="song">I believe I'll see you on the other side, where heaven and earth collide, I can hear the angels singing the sweetest lullaby, I know I'll see you on the other side. Heaven knows how had it is, but I won't give up on <a href="#">love</a>
</div>
<div>
<p>You were indeed a calm person. <br> <strong>Rest on dear friend, till we meet to part no more.</strong></p>
</div>
